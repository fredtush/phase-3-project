    "They say, \"Water is Life\". Tanzania is a developing country which has a clean water problem. According to [worldometers.info](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/tanzania-population/), Tanzania population is 59,353,795 and it has to provide more than 59 million people with clean water. There are many water features which are already well established, but also there are many useless wells or some are in need of repair. \n",
    "\n",
    "Drivendata has begun a competition 'Pump It Up' to point this problem. With the predictive model, people can understand which water points are functional, nonfunctional and functional but it needs to repair. This model can help the Tanzanian government to find likely maintenance needy wells or give an useful information for future wells. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project's aim is to build a model which tells the status of the water points (as functional, nonfunctional, functional but needs repair). With this model, we will help to the Tanzanian authorities how to use water sources as a productive way. It also helps the JICA(Japan International Cooperation Authority) and The Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (DAWASA) and the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Corporation (DAWASCO) invest on Tanzania water resources wisely.

    "- Generally higher population areas has higher number of functional wells.\n",
    "- Some areas have higher probability to find clean water especially, if they are near good basins.\n",

    "- Iringa is one of the important areas but it contains lots of non-functional wateer points which has soft water.\n",
    "- Mostly the wells which are funded by government are non-functional.\n",
    "- Most of water points which central government and district council installed are non-functional.\n",
    "- The most common extraction type is gravity but second is hand pumps. The efficiency of handpumps is less than commercial pumps. This shows that authorities need to focus on pumping type. It is seen that, there are many non-functional water points which belongs to gravity as extraction type.\n",

    "- 4272 wells were dried but they have good water quality. With a sound solution, these wells can be functional. Finding clean water sources is not the only problem, to continue to feed these sources are equaly important.\n",
    "- 2226 (7%) wells have enough and soft water but need repair. Authorities must invest on repairing. Otherwise these will be non-functional.\n",
    "- 8035 (27%) wells has enough, good quality water but they are non-functional. This shows that authorities must work and invest on technology to pump these good sources.\n",

    "Prioritized random forest model based on roc-auc scores. I looked at the balanced accuracy for test set since the metric for competition is balanced accuracy. It is overfit, but still giving good test balanced accurancy results. So, I choose this model. XGBoost is not over fit and giving near results to this model. These are two good models in the project.\n",

    "According to confusion matrix on test data, there is no exact split but it is shown that we will care about 962 points which is already predicted as functional but normally they are non-functional. Also, 698 points are predicted as non-functional but they are functional. With the learnings from binary model, I proceeded to multi-class target model.\n",

    "All of the 3 models I implemented, XGBoost performed best when we used it with SMOTE. So, our new and decided model is XGBoost with SMOTE. With 86% accuracy, we can predict the functionality of the wells. Below is a summary of the results of multiclass target models:\n",
